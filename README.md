## 👋 Hi, I’m Frank

I'm a **Cloud Operations & DevOps Engineer** with a strong focus on automation, observability, and CI/CD for microservice architectures. Most of my professional work has been on proprietary infrastructure, so you won’t see many personal projects here — but that’s changing.

---

### 🔧 What I Do
- 🛠️ Build and scale CI/CD pipelines for microservices
- 🌩️ Automate cloud infrastructure and configuration
- 🔍 Enhance observability and incident response
- 🧪 Tinker in my homelab with open source tools

---

### 🏡 Homelab Enthusiast
Though I’ve spent most of my career in cloud-native environments, running my own hardware has been a liberating experience. I'm in full control — from the OS up — and it's been an incredible learning opportunity to experiment with different tools, architectures, and deployment strategies.

Right now, I'm particularly into:
- 🔄 **Proxmox VE** – my current favorite playground: [community-scripts/ProxmoxVE](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE)
- 🐳 **Containerization & Orchestration** – Docker, Kubernetes, FluxCD, and more
- 📊 **Observability** – Grafana, Prometheus, and custom dashboards
- 🌐 **Self-hosting** – From NGINX to Portainer and beyond

### 🌱 Inspired By
The open source community drives so much of my learning. Some of my favorite GitHub creators:
- [@geerlingguy](https://github.com/geerlingguy)
- [@mischavandenburg](https://github.com/mischavandenburg)
- [@timothystewart6](https://github.com/timothystewart6)
- [@ChristianLempa](https://github.com/ChristianLempa)
- [@ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen)

### ✍️ Coming Soon
I’m planning to document more of my journey — both in homelab experimentation and DevOps insights — over at [frankpejril.com](https://frankpejril.com). Expect more public repos soon with configurations, experiments, and tools I use every day.

Thanks for stopping by!
